# Simple Invite Only Document Management System

My First attempt to learn ASP.NET CORE and EF by building a website where users can login ONLY with an invitation code. 

The Admin can send an email to the users which will contain the said invitation code. When the user logs in, the system must be able to recognize the code a code can only be used ONCE.

After which users can add, edit or delete documents (Books, Articles, Research Docs etc...)

This is a C# Version of the ResearchInternship repo that I did with Django, but aimed at being better.
