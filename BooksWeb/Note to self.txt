1. Create your model
2. Create its public Interface (IModel) as a child to repository<Model>
3. add the update fxn
4. Go to IUnitOfWork and add the Interface as get
5. Go to class UnitOfWork and add the getter and private setter.
6. Create the class of interface and add the DBContext and contructor, then implement the update fxn.
7. Go to ApplicationDbContext and add the DbSet of the new Model,
8. Open the Package Manager Console and add-migration (Make sure your Defaut project is the one which contains ApplicationDbContext)
9. Update Database

finished

=============================================================================================================================================
If migration/updating DB fails because "Introducing FOREIGN KEY constraint 'FK_Products_Categories_CoverTypeId' on table 'Products' may cause cycles" or something like that,
go to the migration and set that foreign key this way "onDelete: ReferentialAction.SetDefault"
